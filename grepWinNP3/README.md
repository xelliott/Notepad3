grepWin is a simple search and replace tool which can use [regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) to do its job. This allows to do much more powerful searches and replaces.

In case you're not familiar with regular expressions, we have a very short [regular expression tutorial](https://tools.stefankueng.com/regexhelp.html) for you.
